# A fork of BalatroMobileCompat
Patches some code to allow Balatro to work properly on mobile. Does nothing on PC.

This fork change Balatro's keyboard with Android keyboard.

This mod requires [Lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector) in order to work.

Patches were taken from [balatro-mobile-builder](https://github.com/PGgamer2/balatro-mobile-builder), so check that for more information on what they do.
